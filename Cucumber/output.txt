You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^Arsnova is up and running$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^I login in to arsnova as a guest$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^asking for my information$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^I should get my information$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
